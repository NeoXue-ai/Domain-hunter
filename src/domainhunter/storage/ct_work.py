"""The CT discovery work queue: lease, retry, and completion.

CT ingestion must probe each new root exactly once even when several sweeps
overlap, so work items are claimed under a time-bounded lease token instead of
being read and marked. This queue is the only hand-off between the ingest
sweep and the digest loop.
